<section id="overview" class="slide level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this activity you are going to learn how to collaborate using
Github. With your team members you will learn some basics which allow
you to share and edit files on Github.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a git repository hosted at GitHub</li>
<li>Build <code>README.md</code> file</li>
<li>Commit changes to repository</li>
<li>Collaborate by forking and editing partners file</li>
<li>Explore Github features: insights, diff, blame, ect.</li>
</ol>

<section id="create-a-repository-with-a-readme.md-file-10-minutes"
class="slide level2">
<h2>Create a repository with a README.md file (10 minutes)</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: First we are going to create a repository
within our Github user account.</p>
<p>Follow along with your instructor and perform these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to your Github profile. The url should be <a
href="">http://github/your-user-gitname</a>.</li>
<li>Create a new Github repository, click <span
style="background:limegreen; color:white">new</span> button, under the
repositories tab.</li>
<li>Name your repository <code>practice1-your-gitname</code></li>
<li>In the details write “tips to working with git and github”.</li>
<li>Click the initiate a <code>README.md file</code> option.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="so-far" class="slide level2">
<h2>So far</h2>
<ul>
<li>Once the repository is created you will be directed to the
repository page which now has its own web address.</li>
<li>Each repository on Github has a unique url so you can easily
share.</li>
<li>The git history is a detailed history of all the changes made to
that file. One of the features of using Github is the ability to view
your repository history which can be displayed in the Insights section
of your Github repository page.</li>
<li>At this point in the git history of your
<code>practice1-your-gitname</code> repository there is only one
commit.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="edit-the-readme.md-file-5-minutes" class="slide level2">
<h2>Edit the <code>README.md</code> file (5 minutes)</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the <code>practice1-your-gitname</code> repository main page.
Click on <code>README.md</code>, then click “edit this file”. Add the
following information into the <code>README.md</code> file:
<ul>
<li>Name?</li>
<li>What do you tell people about your field of study at a party?</li>
<li>In the past month, what are the three main activities you have been
doing at work/study?</li>
<li>What are the three most important tools/strategies you use for
organizing your work?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p class="note">
<em>tip</em>: Notice that you can use markdown syntax. Use <a
href="https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/">this guide</a>
for Github’s flavor of Markdown. Use the “Preview” button to view the
formatting of your readme.md file.
</p>
</section>
<section id="commit" class="slide level2">
<h2>Commit</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commit</strong> takes a snap shot of your project. Each
commit includes a commit message that concisely defines changes made or
project state at the time of the commit.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Summarize the changes that you have made in 50 characters or less
and click the <span style="background:limegreen; color:white"> commit
</span> button.</li>
<li>Check out the git history. You should now see two commits.</li>
</ol>
<!---## Commit statements

Get into the habit of writing commit statements. They will help you later!

<h2>Edit and collaborate with your partner</h2>

</section>
<section id="collaborate" class="slide level2">
<h2>Collaborate</h2>
<p>Now it is time to collaborate with a partner. Navigate to one of your
team members’ repository by searching the url directly in your github
search windown (take a round-robin approach). In order to edit someone
else’s repository you usually follow this simplified work flow:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fork their repository to your user account</li>
<li>Make edits and commit</li>
<li>Create a pull request that merges your changes into their
repository.</li>
</ol>
<p class="note">
<em>tip</em>:
<!---Depending on the project there are variations on the above work flow. Often the rules for contributing to a project are outlined in a file called `CONTRIBUTING.md` within the repository. One of the more often used --->
See the works flows <a

<section id="forking" class="slide level2">
<h2>Forking</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forking</strong> is creating a copy of a git repository into
your own account.<br />
</li>
<li>Forking allows you to make changes to a repository without affecting
the main repository of the project.<br />
</li>
<li>This is one of the most exciting aspects of Github - you essentially
encouraged to copy and play with anyone’s code!</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="forking-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Forking</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>To fork your partner’s repository click the “fork” button in the top
left hand part of your screen.<br />
</li>
<li>When it asks where you would like to fork the repository, choose
your user account (if you are new to Github, this should be the only
option).</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="make-edits-and-commit" class="slide level2">
<h2>Make edits and commit</h2>
<ul>
<li>You should now have a copy of your partners repository,
<code>practice1-their-gitname</code>.</li>

forked copies made of the project.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Edit your partners repository by clicking the edit button.<br />

commit.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="create-a-pull-request" class="slide level2">
<h2>Create a pull request</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>pull request</strong> is the final step in the
collaboration process, essentially asking if the edits made to your copy
can be incorporated into another repository.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make sure you are in your copy of your partner’s repository by
looking at the url - your user name should preface the repository
name.<br />
</li>
<li>Click the <span style="background:limegreen; color:white">New Pull
Request</span> button. You will get an overview of the changes you made
to the repository.</li>
<li>Click the “Create a Pull Request” button to continue the pull
request. Your partner will now get a notification of a pull request on
their main repository, as will you if your partner made changes.</li>

</section>
<section id="explore-github-features" class="slide level2">
<h2>Explore Github Features</h2>
<p>Now that you have accepted the pull request. Take a few minutes to
explore the git history using the Insights section of the
repository.</p>

<h2>Analyzing the “gapminder-5060” dataset</h2>
<p>You may decide what you want to do. For example:</p>
<ol type="1">

<ol type="a">
<li>a table of team members, and their github repository links<br />
</li>
<li>the number of successful pull requests you made, and the github
repository to which you requested a change</li>
<li>the number of pull requests you accepted, and the github repository
from which you accepted</li>
<li>a list with at least 3 tips of how to make working with git/github
easier<br />
</li>
