## Working with date and time


## `lubridate` package

- package for working with dates and times
- defines different classes of time: instants, periods, intervals, durations
- defines converter and accessor functions, enables time calculus

## Converter functions and instants in time

- time instants: one (absolute) moment in time, e.g. `now()`, `Jan-1-2000`
- easy-to-use converter functions: 
    - date: `ymd`, `mdy`, `dmy`, ...
    - time: `hm`, `hms`, ...
    - date & time: `ymd_hms`, `mdy_hm`, ...
- order of letters determines how strings are parsed
- separators are automatically determined, then assumed to be the same

```{r message=FALSE}
mdy("03-01-2018")
dmy("03-01-2018")
```

- <span style="color:white">Create date objects for today's date by typing the date in text format and converting it with one of the `lubridate` converter functions. </span>
- <span style="color:white">Try different formats of writing the date and compare the end results.</span>



## Accessor functions


- accessor functions: `year`, `month`, `week`, `wday`, `mday`, `yday`, `hour`, `minute`, ...
- accessor functions can also be used for setting elements of date and time, e.g. `hour(x) <- 12`

Examples:

```{r}
month(now())
wday(now(), label = TRUE)
```

## Intervals and Durations

- Intervals have a *start* and an *end* date/time: absolute difference
- Durations are potentially of relative length (months, leap year, leap second, ...)

```{r}
end_date <- now()
span <- end_date - years(1)
span
end_date - days(10)
```


## Example: Movies

The date variable can be treated as numeric variables.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(classdata)
summary(box$Date) # date variable: allows date calculus
```


## Example: Movies (cont'd)

The date variable can be treated as numeric variables.

```{r, fig.height = 3.25}
library(tidyverse)

box %>% ggplot(aes(x = Date)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=7)
```

## Example: Movies (cont'd)

Is there a seasonal effect in the number of movies in the box office?

```{r, fig.height = 3.25}
library(lubridate)

box %>% ggplot(aes(x = month(Date, label=TRUE))) + geom_bar()
```

#boxbudget$Diff = week(boxbudget$Date) - week(boxbudget$ReleaseDate) Not right, why?
#boxbudget$Diff = (boxbudget$Date - boxbudget$ReleaseDate) / 7 Seems right, but the format is not good
boxbudget$Diff = as.duration(boxbudget$Date - boxbudget$ReleaseDate) / dweeks(1)

boxbudget = boxbudget %>% mutate(diff.week = as.duration(Date - ReleaseDate) / dweeks(1)) 

boxbudget %>% mutate(diff = diff.week - Week) %>% arrange(diff) %>% View()
